# React Developer Portfolio

## About

A simple portfolio page for a web developer (me) using React and Bulma.

## Setup

If you want to run this site locally, you can clone this repo, then navigate to the project directory in the command line and run `npm i`. Once dependencies are done installing, run `npm start` and the React app should start and then open in your default browser.

## Deployed

You can find the deployed page here: https://bnemeton.github.io/reactPortfolio/ . The deployed code differs slightly (mostly in the navigation links) to run properly on Github Pages.
